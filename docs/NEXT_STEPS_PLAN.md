# Supply Chain Dashboard - Next Development Phase

## 🎯 **Immediate Goals (Next 4 Weeks)**

### **Week 1: Secure Foundation ✅**
- [x] RBAC implementation complete
- [x] Supply chain models updated for multi-tenancy
- [x] API endpoints secured with permissions
- [ ] **TODO: Run migrations and test setup**

### **Week 2: Dashboard with Real Insights 📊**

#### **2.1 Create Sample Supply Chain Data Command**
```python
# backend/api/management/commands/create_sample_data.py
# Generate realistic supply chain data:
# - 50+ products across categories
# - 10+ suppliers and warehouses  
# - 100+ orders with realistic patterns
# - Current inventory levels
# - Recent shipments and deliveries
```

#### **2.2 Build Core Dashboard Components**
```tsx
// frontend/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/components/
├── InventoryOverview.tsx    # Current stock levels, alerts
├── OrderStatusWidget.tsx    # Recent orders, fulfillment rates
├── SupplierPerformance.tsx  # Delivery times, quality metrics
├── ShipmentTracking.tsx     # In-transit shipments
└── KPICards.tsx            # Key metrics summary
```

**Dashboards to Build:**
1. **Executive Dashboard** - High-level KPIs and trends
2. **Operations Dashboard** - Order fulfillment, inventory alerts
3. **Supplier Dashboard** - Performance metrics, delivery tracking
4. **Analytics Dashboard** - Charts, forecasts, insights

### **Week 3: Complete Data Pipeline 🔄**

#### **3.1 Test End-to-End Data Flow**
```bash
# 1. CSV Upload → MongoDB
cp sample_supply_chain.csv datasets/
# (Airflow auto-ingests via watchdog)

# 2. MongoDB → PostgreSQL transformation  
# (Test existing Airflow DAGs)

# 3. PostgreSQL → API → Dashboard
# (Verify data appears in dashboard)
```

#### **3.2 Add Supply Chain Specific Features**
- **Demand Forecasting** using existing ML DAG
- **Inventory Optimization** recommendations
- **Supplier Risk Assessment** automation
- **Real-time Shipment Tracking** integration

### **Week 4: Advanced Features 🚀**

#### **4.1 AI-Powered Analytics**
- **Query Agent Integration** - Natural language supply chain questions
- **Anomaly Detection** - Unusual order patterns, inventory spikes
- **Predictive Insights** - Demand forecasting, supplier delays

#### **4.2 Role-Based Dashboards**
- **CEO View**: Strategic KPIs, regional performance
- **Operations Manager**: Daily operations, fulfillment metrics  
- **Warehouse Manager**: Inventory levels, receiving/shipping
- **Supplier Manager**: Vendor performance, procurement insights
