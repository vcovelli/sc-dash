## 🔐 Role Hierarchy & Permissions

| Role | Can Invite | Can Manage Users | Can View Analytics | Notes |
|------|------------|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **admin** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Platform superuser, no org restriction |
| **owner** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Organization owner, full org access |
| **ceo** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Executive level, can invite but not manage |

| **regional_manager** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | Can invite users, view analytics |
| **local_manager** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Management view access only |
| **employee** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | Basic employee access |
| **client** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Limited external access |

## 🚀 Testing Your RBAC System

### 1. **Setup Test Data**
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py setup_test_org --clean
```

This creates:
- Test Organization
- 5 users with different roles (password: `testpass123`)
- 1 platform admin (password: ``)

### 2. **Test User Accounts**
| Email | Role | Password | Can Access User Management |
|-------|------|----------|----------------------------|
| `owner@test.com` | Owner | `testpass123` | ✅ Yes |
| `manager@test.com` | National Manager | `testpass123` | ✅ Yes (invite only) |
| `employee@test.com` | Employee | `testpass123` | ❌ No |
| `client@test.com` | Client | `testpass123` | ❌ No |
| `readonly@test.com` | Read Only | `testpass123` | ❌ No |
| `admin@supplywise.ai` | Platform Admin | `` | ✅ Yes (all orgs) |

### 3. **Test Scenarios**

#### **User Management Testing**
1. **Login as Owner** (`owner@test.com`)
   - Go to Settings → Team Management
   - ✅ Should see all org users
   - ✅ Should be able to invite new users
   - ✅ Should be able to change user roles
   - ✅ Should be able to remove users

2. **Login as Manager** (`manager@test.com`)
   - Go to Settings → Team Management
   - ✅ Should see all org users
   - ✅ Should be able to invite new users
   - ❌ Should NOT be able to change roles or remove users

3. **Login as Employee** (`employee@test.com`)
   - Go to Settings
   - ❌ Should NOT see "Team Management" option

#### **API Permission Testing**
```bash
# Test with different user tokens
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8000/api/accounts/org/users/

# Owner/Admin: Should return user list
# Manager: Should return user list
# Employee: Should return 403 Forbidden
```

#### **Invitation Flow Testing**
1. **Send Invitation** (as Owner/Manager)
   - Settings → Team Management → Invite User
   - Add email: `newuser@example.com`
   - Select role: `employee`
   - Check pending invitations table

2. **Accept Invitation**
   - Use the invite URL from backend response
   - Create account with provided token
   - Verify user appears in org user list

## 🔧 API Endpoints Added

### User Management
- `GET /api/accounts/org/users/` - List organization users
- `PUT /api/accounts/org/users/{id}/` - Update user role/settings  
- `DELETE /api/accounts/org/users/{id}/remove/` - Remove user from org

### Invitation Management

- `POST /api/accounts/invite/accept/` - Accept invitation (enhanced)
- `GET /api/accounts/invitations/pending/` - List pending invitations
- `DELETE /api/accounts/invitations/{id}/cancel/` - Cancel invitation
